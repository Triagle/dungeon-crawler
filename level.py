    """ Parse a level from a filename pointing to a level text file.

    Levels are ascii text files drawing one for one the layout of the dungeon
    with characters exactly matching those in the game. Returns a level
    containing a dictionary with keys (x, y) coordinates and values the kind of
    tile at this position (WALL or FLOOR). Also returns the player, and a
    dictionary with keys (x, y) and values monsters spawned at a given position.

    Example Level:
